# Intro, Hello World Java

* All code in Java must be part of a class.
* We delimit the beginning and end of segments of code using { and }.
* All statements in Java must end in a semi-colon.
* For code to run we need public static void main(String[] args)
* Before Java variables can be used, they must be declared.
* Java variables must have a specific type.
* Java variable types can never change.
* Types are verified before the code even runs!
* Functions must be declared as part of a class in Java.
   A function that is part of a class is called a "method".
   So in Java, all functions are methods.
* To define a function in Java, we use "public static".
   We will see alternate ways of defining functions later.
* All parameters of a function must have a declared type,
   and the return value of the function must have a declared type.
   Functions in Java return only one value!
* Functions must have a return type. If a function does not return anything, we use void.
